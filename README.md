Manager Brief
Based on the client requirements and company standards and practices, you should include the following:
4 distinct pages/sections; Home, About, Contact, News with a navigation menu on each
Home page/section: 
oShould be the landing page;
oShould have an animated company logo, as per the client description, that animates in before the rest of the content loads (only animated on this page). You will need to use the HTML5 Canvas element for this;
oThe remaining content should animate/transition in after the logo has finished loading;
oThe remaining content should detail services provided and selecting a service should expand the content with more information. Only one service should be displayed at a time;
About page/section:
oThis should include the client’s blurb about their business at the top;
oBelow this, the details regarding the employees should be listed. The employee details will be stored in a database which should include information on the employee’s name, employee ID, contact details, qualifications, and any other information that would be appropriate for a business to keep regarding an employee. Not all the information will be displayed in the website, however, and only the information relevant to the public should be shown.
oThe client has not supplied actual employee information, for security reasons, so you will need to create your own dummy information. You will need to create at least 3 dummy records for testing purposes.
Contact page/section:
oThis should contain a form for users to fill out and should include fields for:
User’s name
Contact details (email and phone number)
And a field where the user can supply a message for the type of information/help they are looking for.
News page/section:
oThis should be a blog style page with a list of articles, displaying the article/post title, a picture and some of the article text.
oAs the client has not provided content at this stage, the use of dummy text and placeholder images should be used to construct this section and demonstrate to the client what it will look like.
oWhen clicked the links should display the entire article, again with dummy text.
oImplement at least 3 dummy articles for this.
The only page that should use php should be the About page. Any other pages should be standard HTML.
Include a footer with a small bit of text that states, “This site was developed by ITWorks ©”.
Ensure the site is professional looking, all mark-up and code is valid, free of errors and adheres to the ITWorks standards.
